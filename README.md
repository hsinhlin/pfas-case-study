This repository contains materials for **Rotation 2: PFAS Exposure Case Study**, conducted in the [Baloni Lab (Purdue University)](https://hhs.purdue.edu/balonilab/).  
The project focuses on **transcriptomic and pathway-level analyses** to investigate the biological effects of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) on liver function.

## Project Overview
PFAS are persistent environmental contaminants associated with liver toxicity and metabolic dysregulation.  
In this case study, bulk RNA-seq data from PFAS-exposed mouse liver were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes and biological genes/pathways that is affected by PFAS exposure.
